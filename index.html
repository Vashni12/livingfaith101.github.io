                                    spent much time researching and asking many
                                    questions. Without knowing where to go, God
                                    led me to pastor Isabel Yoo, the head
                                    pastor. I have received so much love and
                                    wisdom ever since, and I know that the Holy
                                    Spirit guided me. If not for God's grace and

                                    I was born and raised as Jehovah witness
                                    since I was young until I was sixteen then
                                    my family stopped going all together.
                                    Growing up, reading, learn, and watching
                                    stories of the bible, I knew who God was
                                    from the bible, but I never understood him
                                    and there were things in the church that did
                                    not sit right with me and questions that no
                                    one had answers, every keep saying the same
                                    things. So, after my family stop going, I
                                    stopped as well. After this time, I just
                                    live my life like others in this world work
                                    etc. but I always felt lost no purpose. Even
                                    when I had money car, friends etc., it never
                                    filled that hole emptiness I had.
                                    I had things a decent job, car, place to
                                    live etc., but it did not make me happy I
                                    had so many questions but no answers,
                                    everyone keep saying the same things work
                                    make money do this that but that could not
                                    just be it. I had those things it filled
                                    that hole for a little time but then it was
                                    the same empty void again, so I just keep
                                    doing same working, eating, living day by
                                    day. I felt trapped in darkness and vey
                                    lost, did not know what to do anymore.
                                    Then I met people in my life that help to
                                    get me out that darkness. I met a fellow
                                    Christian who help me understand more of who
                                    the God is and help me get out of that
                                    darkness, she gave me answers to some of my
                                    problems I had growing up and in my life.
                                    Then I found my way to this church. I joined
                                    the bible study online, I met Pastor Thomas,
                                    he had guided me in this journey, he answers
                                    so many questions I had my whole life
                                    through these bible studies. I learn more of
                                    who I am as a person and what is my purpose
                                    in this life through these bible studies. It
                                    gave me peace and filled that void I had. I
                                    also found a community that care and wants
                                    you grow in your path from these bible
                                    studies.
                                    Anyone who is lost in this world or use to
                                    go to a church but stopping going try out
                                    the bible studies, I recommend you try it.
                                    It will take some time and effort, but the
                                    result is something that will surprise you
                                    and change you for the better. Thank you for
                                    reading. Have a Bless Day.</p>

                                    knowing His word and everyone who has helped
                                    me along my journey. Everyone who wants to
                                    grow deeper in faith and closer to God
                                    should join the bible study program. It will
                                    change the way you see yourself, the way you
                                    see God, and the way you see your future!

                                    I was not searching for God, but he found
                                    me. I do not regret it. Through these bible
                                    studies and teachings on who God is, I came
                                    to have a deeper love for him and my life on
                                    this Earth. He would speak to me through the
                                    Bible study lessons. It was a path of
                                    building a relationship with him, through
                                    his word, prayer, and my church community.
                                    This has put me on an accelerated path of
                                    growth as a person, which was more than I
                                    could have grown on my own. For that, I am
                                    forever grateful.</p>

                                    Hello! My testimony of faith starts with the
                                    emotional neglect and rejection I have
                                    experienced from my loved ones and friends
                                    as well as my own struggle with my sinful
                                    nature. Although I knew who Jesus Christ was
                                    and that God is love, I didn’t think He
                                    could ever love me because of my sinful and
                                    unnatural nature. I pretended that I was
                                    alright in the face of others in order to
                                    hide my sorrow and pain. I developed severe
                                    trust issues with other people. And I felt
                                    hopeless with my existence. This only made
                                    it worse. In my dark and hurtful valley, God
                                    made Himself known. He showed His love to me
                                    regardless of how many mistakes I have made
                                    and how much shame I had. He restored a
                                    relationship that was emotionally estranged
                                    and He gave the courage to speak to others
                                    about my reality. He gave me a purpose to
                                    exist as well as company when I feel alone.
                                    He has changed me, is changing me, and will
                                    continue to change me until He returns or
                                    calls me home.
                                    He has blessed me with this Bible study
                                    group and church family that walks with me
                                    and hears me. Even though, I still struggle
                                    with completely trusting other people and
                                    being completely honest, I have come a long
                                    way from being with this Bible Study group
                                    and church for about a year. God works
                                    through the missionary in the church. He has
                                    helped me grow and learn about God’s love
                                    and mercy through Jesus Christ, our Savior,
                                    through this Bible study group and church.
                                    He has given me a space in this Bible study
                                    group and church to find the joy of giving
                                    my grieving heart to The Great Healer, the
                                    Lord God. This space can be yours too.
                                    Because through this Bible study group, you
                                    will find a church, and church is not a
                                    building, but its people.</p>

                            <p>
                                The early Christians "continuously devoted
                                themselves to fellowship." (Acts 2:42) The word
                                for "fellowship" in Greek is koinonia, which
                                means "to have in common" or "to share." As
                                those who are united with Christ, we are to
                                share the life of Christ with one another in a
                                way that results in individual and corporate
                                spiritual growth.
